# Ng2 WebWorker Image Demo
This is a demo of WebWorker support in Ng2 that shows how you can achieve a responsive UI in a computationally expensive application using WebWorkers

# Run Demo
First clone the repo and then run `npm run tsc`. This will compile the TypeScript files, and watch for changes.
In a seperate terminal window run `npm start`. This will start up a local webserver and open your browser to the demo page.
To see the demo without WebWorker support navigate to `http://localhost:8080/src/single_thread.html`.
